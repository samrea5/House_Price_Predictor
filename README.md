# House_Price_Predictor
###Introduction
This project is looking to predict trends in the housing market using machine learning. The data is of the housing market in King County (county containing Seattle, Washington). The data was pulled from the redfin data repository and then cleaned using python. The updated csv file was then passed into an R script to make a shiny dashboard visualizing the most important elements. This project is currenlty a work in Progress and there will be more updates surronding the predictions made using a variety of machine learning techniques. 

###Navigation
Currently there are two folders one contains the R script to create the shiny plot. This folder is labeled Data_Visualization. The Second folder contains the data sets as well as the python script used to clean the data for the visualization using R. the clean data set was also included if you do not want to run the data wrangling script as well.
